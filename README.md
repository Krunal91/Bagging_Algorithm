# Bagging_Algorithm
In this Bagging algorithm, I am using decision stump as a weak learner.

## How to run the code  

#### Script requirement  
Scirpt should have read, write and delete permission

###### Script running instruction
Run main.py script in command line as below

python main.py <ensemple_type> <treeDeoth> <bags> <data folder path>

ensemple_type = bag ; for nagging
	      = boost; for boosting
